### Notes
I had struggles getting the posters to properly crop on the collection view for the superhero tab. I also had an issue where my repository wouldn't push on GitHub Desktop. Last issue was trying to get the proper spacing between the collection view cells.

### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges included understanding the some of the code that was written for the sake of the project. I understand that this is just an initial look at Swift but it's nice to know that there's still so much to learn. I had some issues getting some of the IBOutlets to work properly but I was able to figure it out.
